### Tailor

Tailor is a fast, safe, simple web development framework built for the Swift
programming language. It's still in the early stages of development, and isn't
ready for production use, but I'm working hard to get it there.

### How to Use Tailor


Here's what you need to do to start your first Tailor app:

1. Download and run the [Tailor installer](http://www.johnbrownlee.com/s/Tailormpkg.zip)
2. Create your project using the "Tailor Application" template in Xcode

Once you build the app, you can run it on another Mac uploading and running the
app. You'll want to always run it through the command-line so that you can
provide the runtime arguments.

You can find sample apps at
[the official website](https://tailorframe.work/). That site also has
[documentation](https://tailorframe.work/docs/overview/) and
[tutorials](https://tailorframe.work/tutorials/).
