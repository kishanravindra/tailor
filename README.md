### Tailor

Tailor is a fast, secure, simple web development framework built for the Swift
programming language. It's still in the early stages of development, and isn't
ready for production use, but I'm working hard to get it there.

### How to Use Tailor

You can find sample apps at
[the official website](http://johnbrownlee.com/tailor/about). Official
tutorials and documentation will be coming in the future. The sample apps
require a libmysqlclient to be installed, with a module map for using it as a
Swift module.

### Feedback and Contributions

You can give feedback by opening issues in Github, or
[reaching out to me](http://johnbrownlee.com/contact). I know that people say
this sarcastically, but patches are incredibly welcome.
