### Tailor

Tailor is a fast, secure, simple web development framework. It's still in the
early stages of development, and isn't ready for production use.

### How to Use Tailor

You can find sample apps at
[the official website](https://johnbrownlee.com/tailor). Official
tutorials and documentation will be coming in the future. The sample apps
require a libmysqlclient to be installed, with a module map for using it as a
Swift module.
